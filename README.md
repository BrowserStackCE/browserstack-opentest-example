# BrowserStack OpenTest Framework

## Introduction

OpenTest is a free and open source functional test automation tool for web applications, mobile apps and APIs.

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates OpenTest framework with Web and Mobile automation testing capabilities. 

## Features
1. Web testing, with Selenium. All browsers supported. Run tests on your local machine or using a cloud provider.

2. Mobile testing for Android and iOS apps with Appium. Run tests on your local machine or using a cloud provider.

3. API testing, built on top of the Apache HttpClient library.

4. Keyword-driven testing. Assemble your tests using higher-level building blocks which hide the complexity of the underlying technology and let you express yourself in a concise and readable manner.

5. Scripting support. Cover complex test scenarios using JavaScript code, embedded organically within your keyword-driven test to keep things clean and readable.

6. Parallel testing. The number of test sessions you can run in parallel is only limited by the resources of the machine you’re running on (but there’s always more machines in the cloud).

7. Distributed testing. Write tests that execute seamlessly across multiple machines, networks and technologies. Write integration tests that span mobile, web, API and anything in between.

8. Data-driven testing. Run a test multiple times, over a set of data records maintained in a separate data file.

9. Extensible. Integrate with any technology by creating your own custom test actions (keywords).

10. Source control-friendly by design. Work with confidence, knowing that Git has your back. Perfect for large or geographically distributed teams.

11. Environments. Build your tests once and run against multiple environments or using different sets of test data.

12. Works well with others. Use the simple HTTP API to take control of starting and monitoring test sessions, collecting test results, etc.

13. Cross-platform, running on macOS, Windows and Linux.

## Repository setup

- Clone the repository

- Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on the machine
   - Node.js 8 or greater
   - Java runtime 8 or greater

- Install from npm:
```
   npm install opentest -g
```

Video tutorial: https://getopentest.org/docs/installation.html (recorded on Windows)

## Quick start

1. Open a new terminal window, cd to the server working directory and start the OpenTest server:

```
   cd ~/opentest/server
   opentest server
```
The OpenTest `server` (aka the sync server) is a Node.js application who’s main functions are to orchestrate test execution and to provide a web-based UI.

2. Open a new terminal window, cd to the actor’s working directory and start the test actor:

```
   cd ~/opentest/actor1
   opentest actor
```

The `test actor` is a Java application that runs on the system under test and executes test steps as instructed by the sync server.

The `server` and the `actor1` directories are going to be used as the working directories for the OpenTest server and test actor, respectively. The `test-repo` directory is a sample test repository that demonstrates some basic features of OpenTest.

3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3200. (You can change the `syncServerUrl` in actor.yml)
4. From the menu, select Session > Create Session From Template. Select the template Quick start tests and click Create session. Wait a few seconds and refresh your browser to view the result of the test session.
